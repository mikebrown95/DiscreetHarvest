Smart Farming Privacy Preserving Machine Learning 

Methods: 
1.) Differential Privacy 
2.) Federated Learning
3.) Homomorphic Encyrption 
4.) Hybrid (Combination of above) 


Models: 

1.) Linear Regression model to predict wheat yield based on IoT sensor data

2.) CNN classifier to predict healthy or diseased bean crops (Healthy, Angular Leaf Spot and Bean Rust.)
